# Swank Clojure

**Important**: [Swank Clojure has moved!](http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure)

[Swank Clojure](http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure) is a
server that allows [SLIME](http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) (the
Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) to connect to Clojure
projects. To use it you must launch a swank server, then connect to it
from within Emacs.
