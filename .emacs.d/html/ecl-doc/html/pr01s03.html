  The <span class="application">ECL</span> project is an implementation of the Common-Lisp language inherits
  from many other previous projects, as shown in <a class="xref" href="pr01s03.html#fig.family-tree" title="Figure 1. ECL's family tree">Figure 1</a>. The oldest ancestor is the Kyoto Common Lisp, an
  implementation developed at the the Research Institute for Mathematical
  Sciences, Kyoto University <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#bib.KCL">KCL</a>. This
  implementation was developed partially in C and partially in Common Lisp
  itself and featured a lisp to C translator.</p>

  <p>The <acronym class="acronym">KCL</acronym> implementation remained a propietary project
  for some time. During this time, William F. Schelter improved
  <acronym class="acronym">KCL</acronym> in several areas and developed Austin Kyoto
  Common-Lisp (<acronym class="acronym">AKCL</acronym>). However, those changes had to be
  distributed as patches over the propietary <acronym class="acronym">KCL</acronym>
  implementation and it was not until much later that both
  <acronym class="acronym">KCL</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">AKCL</acronym> became freely available
  and gave rise to the GNU Common Lisp project, <acronym class="acronym">GCL</acronym>.</p>

  <p>Around the 90's, Giusseppe Attardi worked on the <acronym class="acronym">KCL</acronym>
  and <acronym class="acronym">AKCL</acronym> code basis to produce an implementation of
  Common Lisp that could be embedded in other C programs <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#bib.ECL">ECL</a>. The result was an implementation sometimes known as
  <acronym class="acronym">ECL</acronym> and sometimes as <acronym class="acronym">ECoLisp</acronym>, which
  achieved rather good compliance to the informal specification of the language
  in <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#bib.CLTL2">CLTL2</a>, and which run on a rather big number of platforms.</p>

  <p>The <span class="application">ECL</span> project stagnated a little bit in the coming years. In
  particular, certain dependencies such as object binary formats, word sizes
  and some C quirks made it difficult to port it to new platforms. Furthermore,
  <span class="application">ECL</span> was not compliant with the <acronym class="acronym">ANSI</acronym> specification, a
  goal that other Common Lisps were struggling to achieve.</p>

  <p>This is where the <acronym class="acronym">ECLS</acronym> or
  <acronym class="acronym">ECL</acronym>-Spain project began. Juanjo García-Ripoll took
  the ECoLisp sources and worked on them, with some immediate goals in mind:
  increase portability, make the code 64-bit clean, make it able to build
  itself from scratch, without other implementation of Common Lisp and restore
  the ability to link <span class="application">ECL</span> with other C programs.</p>

  <p>Those goals were rather quickly achieved. <span class="application">ECL</span> became ported to a
  number of platforms and with the years also compatibility with the
  <acronym class="acronym">ANSI</acronym> specification became a more important goal. At some
  point the fork <acronym class="acronym">ECLS</acronym>, with agreement of Prof. Attardi, took
  over the original <acronym class="acronym">ECL</acronym> implementation and it became what it
  is nowadays, a community project.</p>

  <p>The <span class="application">ECL</span> project owes a lot to different people who have contributed
  in many different aspects, from pointing out bugs and incompatibilities of
  <span class="application">ECL</span> with other programs and specifications, to actually solving these bugs
  and porting <span class="application">ECL</span> to new platforms.</p>

  <p>Currently, development of <span class="application">ECL</span> is still driven by Juanjo
  García-Ripoll with the help of Michael Goffioul in the Windows
  port. The project homepage is located at <a class="ulink" href="http://ecls.sourceforge.net" target="_top"><code class="uri">http://ecls.sourceforge.net</code></a>,
  and there is a mailing list where questions, bug reports and other
  discussions may be carried out.</p>
