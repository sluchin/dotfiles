  <p>The signal handling facilities in <span class="application">ECL</span> are constrained by two
  needs. First of all, we can not ignore the synchronous signals mentioned in
  <a class="xref" href="ch30s02.html#ext.signals.synchronous" title="7.2.1. Synchronous signals">Section 7.2.1</a>. Second, all other signals should
  cause the least harm to the running threads. Third, when a signal is handled
  synchronously using a signal handler, the handler should do almost nothing
  unless we are completely sure that we are in an interruptible region, that is
  outside system calls, in code that <span class="application">ECL</span> knows and controls.</p>

  <p>The way in which this is solved is based on the existence of both
  synchronous and asynchronous signal handling code, as explained in the
  following two sections.</p>

  <div class="section" title="7.3.1. Handling of asynchronous signals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ext.signals.asynchronous-handler"></a>7.3.1. Handling of asynchronous signals</h3></div></div></div>
   

   <p>In systems in which this is possible, <span class="application">ECL</span> creates a signal handling
   thread to detect and process asynchronous signals (See <a class="xref" href="ch30s02.html#ext.signals.asynchronous" title="7.2.2. Asynchronous signals">Section 7.2.2</a>). This thread is a trivial one and does
   not process the signals itself: it communicates with, or launches new signal
   handling threads to act accordingly to the denoted events.</p>

   <p>The use of a separate thread has some nice consequences. The first
   one is that those signals will not interrupt any sensitive code. The
   second one is that the signal handling thread will be able to execute
   arbitrary lisp or C code, since it is not being executed in a sensitive
   context. Most important, this style of signal handling is the recommended
   one by the POSIX standards, and it is the one that Windows uses.</p>

   <p>The installation of the signal handling thread is dictated by a boot
   time option, <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_SIGNAL_HANDLING_THREAD</code>, and it will
   only be possible in systems that support either POSIX or Windows
   threads.</p>

   <p>Systems which embed <span class="application">ECL</span> as an extension language may wish to
   deactivate the signal handling thread using the previously mentioned
   option. If this is the case, then they should take appropriate measures to
   avoid interrupting the code in <span class="application">ECL</span> when such signals are delivered.</p>

   <p>Systems which embed <span class="application">ECL</span> and do not mind having a separate signal
   handling thread can control the set of asynchronous signals which is handled
   by this thread. This is done again using the appropriate boot options such
   as <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGINT</code>,
   <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGTERM</code>, etc. Note that in order to detect
   and handle those signals, <span class="application">ECL</span> must block them from delivery to any other
   thread. This means changing the <code class="function">sigprocmask()</code> in POSIX
   systems or setting up a custom <code class="function">SetConsoleCtrlHandler()</code>
   in Windows.</p>

  <div class="section" title="7.3.2. Handling of synchronous signals"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="ext.signals.synchronous-handler"></a>7.3.2. Handling of synchronous signals</h3></div></div></div>
   

   <p>We have already mentioned that certain synchronous signals and
   exceptions can not be ignored and yet the corresponding signal handlers are
   not able to execute arbitrary code. To solve this seemingly impossible
   contradiction, <span class="application">ECL</span> uses a simple solution, which is to mark the sections of
   code which are interruptible, and in which it is safe for the handler to run
   arbitrary code. All other regions would be considered "unsafe" and would be
   protected from signals and exceptions.</p>

   <p>In principle this "marking" of safe areas can be done using POSIX
   functions such as <code class="function">pthread_sigmask()</code> or
   <code class="function">sigprocmask()</code>. However in practice this is slow, as it
   involves at least a function call, resolving thread-local variables, etc,
   etc, and it will not work in Windows.</p>

   <p>Furthermore, sometimes we want signals to be detected but not to be
   immediately processed. For instance, when reading from the terminal we want
   to be able to interrupt the process, but we can not execute the code from
   the handler, since the C function which is used to read from the terminal,
   <code class="function">read()</code>, may have left the input stream in an
   inconsistent, or even locked state.</p>

   <p>The approach in <span class="application">ECL</span> is more lightweight: we install our own signal
   handler and use a thread-local variable as a flag that determines whether
   the thread is executing interrupt safe code or not. More precisely, if the
   variable <code class="code">ecl_process_env()-&gt;disable_interrupts</code> is set, signals
   and exceptions will be postponed and then the information about the signal
   is queued. Otherwise the appropriate code is executed: for instance invoking
   the debugger, jumping to a condition handler, quitting, etc.</p>

   <p>Systems that embed <span class="application">ECL</span> may wish to deactivate completely these
   signal handlers. This is done using the boot options,
   <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGFPE</code>,
   <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGSEGV</code>,
   <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_TRAP_SIGBUS</code>,
   <code class="varname">ECL_OPT_TRAP_INTERRUPT_SIGNAL</code>.</p>

   <p>Systems that embed <span class="application">ECL</span> and want to allow handling of synchronous
   signals should take care to also trap the associated lisp conditions that
   may arise. This is automatically taken care of by functions such as
   <code class="function">si_safe_eval()</code>, and in all other cases it can be solved
   by enclosing the unsafe code in a <code class="function">CL_CATCH_ALL_BEGIN</code>
   frame (See <a class="xref" href="re89.html" title="CL_CATCH_ALL"><code class="function">CL_CATCH_ALL</code></a>).</p>
